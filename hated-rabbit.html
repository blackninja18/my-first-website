        After that day everyone and mostly his friends hated him because the rabbit every time he made fun of his friends and of all the other animals.
He boasted of how he was a grate animal and he said that he was the best.
A day his "friends" was fed up of him so they decided to kill him!
The wolf called his friend lion to kill the rabbit and together they decided a plan.
The rabbit was running in the wood and suddenly he saw a carrot and he started to follow her but when the carrot stoped to move and the rabbit cached it, the lion jumped on the rabbit and he ate the rabbit all in one bite.
