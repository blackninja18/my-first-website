        They was all three ready and waiting for the start.
        "Start" shouted the fawn and the three friends started running like a missile through the route, the wolf was taller so ran faster than the two friends.
         The wolf was really far from them so he decided to relax a little bit,
         but when he woke up the rabbit and the fox was so close to the end so the wolf ran faster than the wind
          and when he was behind them at the last meter of the race he did two jumps and won!
        The wolf became the fastest animal of the wood.
