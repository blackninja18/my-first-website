        After that day everyone and mostly his friends hated him because the fox every time he made fun of his friends and of all the other animals.
        He boasted of how he was a grate animal and he said that he was the best.
        A day his "friends" was fed up of him so they decided to kill him! The wolf called his friend lion to kill the fox and together they decided a plan.
        The fox was running in the wood and suddenly he saw a chicken and he started to follow her but when the chicken stoped to move and the fox cached it, the lion jumped on the fox and he ate the fox all in one bite.
