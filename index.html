    <p>Once upon a time, in a beautiful wood, a group of friends that always stayed together did a race.
        Started all a lot of time a go, in the rabbit house, laughing and eating all together like a family, until the rabbit asked the word and started to talk of his day, he said that he was running in the countryside and he smelled a delicious smell, so slowly, slowly he arrived to a little house.
        He tried to climb the window to see what there was inside, and when he was doing the last effort to arrive he heard a voice saying, "mark, you know which is the fastest creature? It's the rabbit!"
        So when he arrived to the window, from the excitement he fell down and then he ran faster that he could to say that to his friends.
        The wolf and the fox started discussing saying, "I am the faster!", "no I am". It was a long discussion and at the end they decided to do a race to see who is faster.
        They decided the route for the race and then they asked to their friend fawn to do the referee.
