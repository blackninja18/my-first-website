        The friends of the fox at the start they were frustrated but with the time they accepted the defeat and they lived like if anything happened apart for the thing that the fox became important and friend of all the animals of the wood, the wolf and the fox were made fun of by all the animals of the wood but they don't cared of what the other animals said.
        So they lived happily for ever.
