        They was all three ready to start and waiting for the start.
        "Start" shouted the fawn and the three friends started running like a missile through the route, the rabbit was smaller and lighter so more faster than the two friends. The rabbit was far from them so he decided to eat something, but when he finished eating the wolf and the fox was so close to the end so the rabbit had an idea, he threw chestnut to the wolf, the wolf thought that was the fox so they started arguing. The rabbit in the mean time ran faster than the wind and crossed the line of the end! The rabbit became the fastest animal of the wood.
        The rabbit celebrated and said, "you see that the man was right, I am the faster!"
