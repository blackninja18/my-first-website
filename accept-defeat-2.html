        The friends of the rabbit at the start they were frustrated but with the time they accepted the defeat and they lived like if anything happened apart for the thing that the rabbit became important and friend of all the animals of the wood and the wolf and the fox were made fun of by all the animals of the wood but they don't cared of what the other animals said.
        So they lived happily for ever.
